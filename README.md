Fishing Game by Sarah, Kushi, and Connor: a great way to pass time is to fish to your heart's content. 

Notes: make sure to not have spaces in your folder names when running the project; otherwise, the program will not generate the images properly and will look quite odd. Also, when clicking the Help Panel, ensure that you press the up and down arrows both at least once to re-activate your fishing line.
