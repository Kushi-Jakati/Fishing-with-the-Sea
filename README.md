Fishing Game by Sarah Sheets, Kushi Jakati, and Connor Moran: a great way to pass time is to fish to your heart's content. 

Notes: When running the project, do not have spaces in your folder names; otherwise, the program will not generate the images properly and will look odd. Also, when clicking the Help Panel, ensure that you press the up and down arrows both at least once to re-activate your fishing line.
